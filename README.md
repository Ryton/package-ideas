# ðŸ§ª Arturo Package Lab

Or... package ideas for **[Arturo](https://github.com/arturo-lang/arturo)**

This isn't a real repo, properly-speaking, more like a collection of ideas that could become Arturo packages (although not implemented yet!).

--------------

- [ ] GitHub API wrapper, e.g. [this Ruby gem](https://github.com/piotrmurach/github)
- [ ] A benchmarking suite, like [Hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine)
- [ ] An HTML-generation DSL, like [this](https://github.com/arturo-lang/art-html-module) - still very draft-ish
- [ ] A database/SQL DSL, like [this](https://github.com/arturo-lang/art-db-module) - also very draft-ish, but shouldn't be too difficult to implement
- [ ] Matriches math toolbox => processing of lists and nested lists (2 to N levels-deep). including overloading functions for math operations + - * / , + and  extra functions like transposing, reshaping, multiplication/divison, determinant, jacobians, ...,  A bit like python's numpy or matlabs array functions. => i could make a mockup for this.
- [ ] A simple table/image visualisation and CLI-update toolbox. Could be on terminal or in separate window. For example https://github.com/dpayne/cli-visualizer
- [ ] A (basic) image generation and/or visualisation suite like matplotlib, plotly, QT imageviewer. Might be linked to grafito? Could be a simple bmp or png encoder first, linked to external viewer.
